	<div class="content"><br><br>Hi, I'm <p class="bold">Ace</p>! I'm based in <p class="bold"><span title="Melbourne">Naarm</span>, Australia</p>. I'm in my thirties, I identify as <p class="bold">nonbinary</p> and use <p class="bold">they/them pronouns</p>. I enjoy creating <p class="bold">accessible and useable websites</p> for everyone. When I'm not making websites I enjoy playing with <p class="bold">data</p> and everything that can offer me. <br><br>
	
	Outside of computers, I enjoy reading, collecting books, soft toys, fandom and spending time with friends. I also volunteer and am heavily into progressive politics.</div></header>
